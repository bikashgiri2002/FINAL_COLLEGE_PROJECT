MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Here's how these technologies can be used to build an inventory management system:

Backend (Node.js and Express):
The backend will consist of a Node.js server running on top of the Express framework, which will provide the API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the database. The backend will interact with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve inventory data. Some of the backend APIs could include:
Authentication APIs for admin login
APIs for adding, updating, and deleting products
APIs for adding purchase details and updating stock
APIs for adding store/location details
APIs for adding sales details
APIs for viewing products and quantity available in stock
APIs for viewing sales on stores
API for predicting/forecasting sales using Simple Linear Regression
Frontend (React):
The frontend will be built using the React library, which will interact with the backend APIs to display the inventory data to the user. The frontend could consist of:
Login page for admin
Pages for adding, updating, and deleting products
Pages for adding purchase details and updating stock
Pages for adding store/location details
Pages for adding sales details
Pages for viewing products and quantity available in stock
Pages for viewing sales on stores
Page for predicting/forecasting sales using Simple Linear Regression
Folder structure:
The folder structure for a MERN stack project could look like:
backend/
models/ (contains the database models)
routes/ (contains the API routes)
controllers/ (contains the API controllers)
config/ (contains the configuration files)
index.js (entry point for the backend)
frontend/
src/
components/ (contains the reusable components)
pages/ (contains the pages)
services/ (contains the API services)
App.js (entry point for the frontend)
public/ (contains the public assets)
package.json (contains the project dependencies)
Overall, this is a high-level overview of how a MERN stack project could be structured. The exact implementation and folder structure will depend on the specific requirements and features of your inventory management system.









Users Collection:

_id (ObjectId)
username (string)
password (string)
role (string)
Products Collection:

_id (ObjectId)
name (string)
description (string)
manufacturer (string)
Purchases Collection:

_id (ObjectId)
product_id (ObjectId)
quantity (int)
purchase_date (date)
Stores Collection:

_id (ObjectId)
name (string)
address (string)
Sales Collection:

_id (ObjectId)
product_id (ObjectId)
store_id (ObjectId)
quantity (int)
sale_date (date)
total_sale_amount (float)
Note: The above schema is just an example and can be modified as per the specific requirements of the system.

Additionally, we can create indexes on the frequently used fields to improve the performance of the system. For example, we can create indexes on product_id, store_id, and sale_date fields in the Sales collection to speed up queries related to sales data. Similarly, we can create indexes on product_id and purchase_date fields in the Purchases collection to optimize queries related to purchase data.
