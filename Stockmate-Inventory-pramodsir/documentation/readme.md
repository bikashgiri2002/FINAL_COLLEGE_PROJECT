DFD-Diagram:
 DFDs are used to visually represent the flow of data within a system, showcasing how inputs are transformed into outputs through various processes.
Components:
Processes: Represent the actions taken to transform data.
Data Stores: Where data is stored within the system.
External Entities: Sources or destinations of data outside the system.
Data Flows: Arrows that indicate the movement of data between entities, processes, and data stores.
DFDs are a helpful tool for understanding and documenting the functional aspects of a system
